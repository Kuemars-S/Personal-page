    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Kuemars Siddiqi. I am a second year student at AUCA and I have a passion for technology. My hobbies include practicing penetration testing in my virtual machines, playing hacking war games, playing the guitar, singing, and working out. While I am introverted, I do not hesitate to interact with others in a friendly manner. I hope to learn a lot from this course and be able to develop functional as well as interactive websites. I have attached a picture of myself below in case you wanted to see.
