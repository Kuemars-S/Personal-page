            <h3>ABOUT</h3>
            <p>My name is Kuemars Siddiqi, a second year transfer student at AUCA. My hobbies consist of coding, penetration testing, playing the guitar, playing piano, singing, and etc. I have an extensive background in Cyber security, but I am still trying to find what I enjoy in the field of Tech. I am mostly an introvert, but I try to be more extroverted for the sake of socializing. I have a humorous personality and I enjoy making people laugh. Aside from that, I am also creative but often end up overthinking. In my spare time, I try helping my friends and anyone else that might need it.</p>
